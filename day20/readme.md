If you only paid enough rent for half a year, your account would get erased after six months. 
If you paid for two years of rent in advance, the account would be “rent exempt.” 
The account would never have to pay rent again. 
Nowadays, all accounts are required to be rent-exempt; you cannot pay less than 2 years of rent.

Although rent is computed on a “per byte” basis, accounts with zero data are not free; Solana still has to index them and store metadata about them.

When accounts are initialized, the amount of rent needed is computed in the background; you don’t need to calculate the rent explicitly.
