 Solana has an RPC function getSignaturesForAddress which lists all the transactions an address has done. The address can be a program or a wallet.

The following is a script to list the transactions from an address:

let web3 = require('@solana/web3.js');

const solanaConnection = new web3.Connection(web3.clusterApiUrl("mainnet-beta"));

const getTransactions = async(address,limit) => {
  const pubKey = new web3.PublicKey(address);
  let transactionList = await solanaConnection.getSignaturesForAddress(pubKey, {limit: limit});
  let signatureList = transactionList.map(transaction => transaction.signature);

  console.log(signatureList);

  for await (const sig of signatureList) {
    console.log(await solanaConnection.getParsedTransaction(sig, {maxSupportedTransactionVersion: 0}));
  }
}

let myAddress = "enter and address here";

getTransactions(myAddress, 3);
